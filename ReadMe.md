## How to use our Notebooks

#### 1. Install the requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt #Preferable to install on a Virtual ENV
```

> **If OSx / Linux use pip3 instead of pip**

#### 2. Running the Notebooks

##### Problem 01 :

There are 2 Notebooks  `problem_01.ipynb`   and  `test_dataprep.ipynb`.

`problem_01.ipynb` is the actual problem notebook

`test_dataprep.ipynb` is to clean the test Dataset. Which is then exported to be used by the main Notebook.

This all could have avoided and made into a single Notebook but it was clumsy. So for better readability we had to make two Notebook.

##### Problem 02 :

Run the `problem_02.ipynb` and the solution will be outputted.

#### 3. Answer Folder

After the execution of both the notebooks the .csv file solutions wil be exported.

These .csv files (solutions) are present into the Answer_files.
